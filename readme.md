### Ruby Blackjack

#### Introduction
----
**Ruby Blackjack** is intended to be a command line implementation of Blackjack in **Ruby**... Go Figure.

#### Future Intentions
----
The project is still not 100% completed, with one major feature missing, winner calculation, although you can bust and let the Dealer win.  

The main game loop still needs to be extrapolated into it's own class so that you can run multiple games without having to restart the whole program.
