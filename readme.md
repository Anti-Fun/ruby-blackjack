### Ruby Blackjack

#### Introduction
----
**Ruby Blackjack** is intended to be a command line implementation of Blackjack in **Ruby**... Go Figure. My major concern was modelling the cards and the deck for portability amongst other casino games for use in other projects.

#### Future Intentions
----
The project is still not 100% complete and has outstanding features.

TODO: 
1. Allow player to split.
2. Implement the "shoe" class, i.e. 2-3 decks in one shoe to play from.
2a. Implement advanced wager bet on doubles/same suits like the real casino.
3. Allow player to double down.
